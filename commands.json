Text is ignored, which allows you to add a description to your rolls:\n```\n.ironsworn-action Rolling to Compel the guard to let me pass by telling him I have business with the Prince. +2 Shadow and +1 for my Secure Advantage.```\nThe command has a few aliases (`is`, `act`, and `a`). All you need are the numeric modifiers; the text is purely for flavour. All aliases function exactly the same:\n```\n.is Compelling the guard by lying: +2 Shadow, +1 Secure Advantage```\n```\n.act Compel +2 s +1 SA```\n`+`'s can be omitted, as well as any text:\n```\n.a 2 1```\nYou can put as much text, and as many modifiers, into a roll as Discord's 2,000-character limit will allow.",
